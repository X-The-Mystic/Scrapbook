#Sketchbook Initiative
This idea was concieved in 2023, when I and a couple of friends decided to begin the contruction of a PenSec tool, similar to Rapid7's Metasploit Framework. I wanted it to be integrated into Linux, and I wanted it to be like the NSA's TAO tool Fuzzbunch. It started out as little nmore than a dump for rough code, but through continuos development, it has reached a point where testing (not even close to alpha, but not just "let's see if this will work"-type testing) can begin. 

Any and all code in here is for educational purposes only.
